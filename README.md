# Promise Fundamentals

In this exercise, you'll need to solve a set of increasingly difficult puzzles aimed at helping you master the fundamentals of Promises. To get started, fork and clone this repository.

Then, change into the project directory.

```shell
cd wd-promise-fundamentals
```

And install the necessary dependencies with NPM.

```shell
npm install
```

## Part 1

Follow the instructions in `lib/1_new_promise.js`. Test your code by running the following shell command.

```shell
npm test test/1_new_promise.test.js
```

## Part 2

Follow the instructions in `lib/2_pokemon.js`. Test your code by running the following shell command.

```shell
npm test test/2_pokemon.test.js
```

## Part 3

Follow the instructions in `lib/3_pokemon_form.js`. Test your code by running the following shell command.

```shell
npm test test/3_pokemon_form.test.js
```

## Part 4

Follow the instructions in `lib/4_pokemon_form_version_group.js`. Test your code by running the following shell command.

## Bonus

Right now, the [`arrow-body-style`](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/arrow-body-style) ESLint rule is turned off. In the `.eslintrc.js` file, enable the rule as needed with the following configuration.

```javascript
'arrow-body-style': ['error', 'as-needed']
```


And lint the code.

```shell
npm run lint
```
